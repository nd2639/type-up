<h1>Typeup</h1>
<p class="intro">Typeup is a Sass mixin that creates a baseline-conforming, vertically rhythmic and very readable typography based on <em>font size</em> and <em>line length</em>. You can use it to kickstart your typography on blogs and websites.</p>

<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<pre><code>.text-wrapper {
    @include typeup-container($fontSize, $lineLength, $xHeight);
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automatically adjusts line height for readability depending on line length</li>
<li>Adjust line height with <code>$xHeight</code> for fonts with low or high x-heights</li>
<li>Set baseline shift for headings with <code>$h[n]-baseline-shift</code> or for all headings with <code>$headingBaselineShift</code>. Default is <code>0.15em</code>.</li>
<li>Set how many baselines of spacing headings have with <code>$h[n]-lines-before</code> or for all headings with <code>$heading-lines-before</code>. You can do the same for after.</li>
<li><a href="http://modularscale.com/">Modular scale</a> for font-sizing, specify the ratio with <code>$ratio</code></li>
<li>Line-height is based on line length to maintain readability at all times</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also supply a <code>$xHeight</code> argument (default <code>1</code>) to finetune the baseline with fonts that have very low or high x-heights.</p>
<h2>CSS for This Container</h2>
<p>This container is made with Typeup defaults.</p>
<pre><code>$fontSize: 1em;
$lineLength: 35em;
$xHeight: 1;
</code></pre>		</div>
		<div class='second'>
<h1>Typeup can do narrow</h1>
<p>Don't worry, Typeup won't let you down. Line height is shortened when text is narrow, optimizing readability. Nice!</p>
<h2>Everything</h2>
<p>Yes, everything.</p>
<h3>Is Still</h3>
<p>Very much.</p>
<h4>Vertically</h4>
<p>Not horizontally.</p>
<h5>Rhythmic</h5>
<p>Yes!</p>
<h3>Filler text, coming up!</h3>
<p>The powered flight took a total of about eight and a half minutes. It seemed to me it had gone by in a lash. We had gone from sitting still on the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center to traveling at 17,500 miles an hour in that eight and a half minutes.</p>
<h2>CSS for This Container</h2>
<pre><code>$fontSize: 0.9em;
$lineLength: 15em;
$xHeight: 1;
</code></pre>		</div>
		<div class='wide'>
<h1>Typeup can do wiiide.</h1>
<p>Everything is still cool, don't worry! As you set the line length wider, Typeup compensates by widening the line height so that readability won't suffer.</p>

We had gone from sitting still on the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center to traveling at 17,500 miles an hour in that eight and a half minutes. It is still mind-boggling to me. I recall making some statement on the air-to-ground radio for the benefit of my fellow astronauts, who had also been in the program a long time, that it was well worth the wait.</p>			<blockquote>
				That's one small step for [a] man; one giant leap for mankind.

<p>Since, in the long run, every planetary civilization will be endangered by impacts from space, every surviving civilization is obliged to become spacefaring--not because of exploratory or romantic zeal, but for the most practical reason imaginable: staying alive... If our long-term survival is at stake, we have a basic responsibility to our species to venture to other worlds.</p>		</div>
