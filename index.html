<h1>Type Up can do narrow</h1>
<p>Line height is shortened when text is narrow, optimizing readability. Nice!</p>
<h2>Everything</h2>
<p>The powered flight took a total of about eight and a half minutes. It seemed to me it had gone by in a lash. We had gone from sitting still on the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center to traveling at 17,500 miles an hour in that eight and a half minutes.</p>
<p>Since, in the long run, every planetary civilization will be endangered by impacts from space, every surviving civilization is obliged to become spacefaring--not because of exploratory or romantic zeal, but for the most practical reason imaginable: staying alive... If our long-term survival is at stake, we have a basic responsibility to our species to venture to other worlds.</p>
<h3>Is Still</h3>
<p>Very much.</p>
<h4>Vertically</h4>
<p>Not horizontally.</p>
<h5>Rhythmic</h5>
<p>Yes!</p>
<h3>Filler text, coming up!</h3>

<h1>Type Up can do wiiide.</h1>
<p>Everything is still cool, don't worry! As you set the line length wider, Typeup compensates by widening the line height so that readability won't suffer.</p>

We had gone from sitting still on the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center to traveling at 17,500 miles an hour in that eight and a half minutes. It is still mind-boggling to me. I recall making some statement on the air-to-ground radio for the benefit of my fellow astronauts, who had also been in the program a long time, that it was well worth the wait.</p>			<blockquote>
				That's one small step for [a] man; one giant leap for mankind.
