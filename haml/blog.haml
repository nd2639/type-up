				# Hello Bandit
				
				I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. Tell him time is of the essence.
				
				## See-Through

				I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I have a dark side, too.

				* Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.
				* Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.

				### Let's Give the Boy a Hand
				
				Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client.
				
				#### Go Your Own Way
				
				I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Cops, another community I'm not part of. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. I am not a killer.

				* I think he's got a crush on you, Dex!
				* I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.
				* I'm really more an apartment person.

				##### Morning Comes
				
				Watching ice melt. This is fun. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. Hello, Dexter Morgan. You all right, Dexter? I'm really more an apartment person.
