				# Typeup

				<p class="intro">Typeup is a Compass extension that creates a baseline-conforming, vertically rhythmic and very readable typography based on <em>font size</em> and <em>line length</em>. You can use it to kickstart your typography on blogs and websites.</p>

				## Basic Usage

					.text-wrapper {
						@include typeup-container($fontSize, $lineLength, $xHeight)
					}


				## Features

				* Automatically adjusts line height for readability depending on line length
				* Adjust line height with `$xHeight` for fonts with low or high x-heights
				* Set baseline shift for headings with `$h[n]-baseline-shift` or for all headings with `$headingBaselineShift`. Default is `0.15em`.
				* Set how many baselines of spacing headings have with `$h[n]-lines-before` or for all headings with `$heading-lines-before`. You can do the same for after.
				* [Modular scale](http://modularscale.com/) for font-sizing, specify the ratio with `$ratio`
				* Line-height is based on line length to maintain readability at all times


				You can also supply a `$xHeight` argument (default `1`) to finetune the baseline with fonts that have very low or high x-heights.

				## CSS for This Container

				This container is made with Typeup defaults.

					$fontSize: 1em;
					$lineLength: 35em;
					$xHeight: 1;

				# Typeup can do narrow

				Don't worry, Typeup won't let you down. Line height is shortened when text is narrow, optimizing readability. Nice!

				## Everything

				Yes, everything.

				### Is Still

				Very much.

				#### Vertically

				Not horizontally.

				##### Rhythmic

				Yes!

				### Filler text, coming up!

				The powered flight took a total of about eight and a half minutes. It seemed to me it had gone by in a lash. We had gone from sitting still on the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center to traveling at 17,500 miles an hour in that eight and a half minutes.

				# Typeup can do wiiide.

				Everything is still cool, don't worry! As you set the line length wider, Typeup compensates by widening the line height so that readability won't suffer.

				The powered flight took a total of about eight and a half minutes. It seemed to me it had gone by in a lash. We had gone from sitting still on the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center to traveling at 17,500 miles an hour in that eight and a half minutes. It is still mind-boggling to me. I recall making some statement on the air-to-ground radio for the benefit of my fellow astronauts, who had also been in the program a long time, that it was well worth the wait.

				That's one small step for [a] man; one giant leap for mankind.

				Since, in the long run, every planetary civilization will be endangered by impacts from space, every surviving civilization is obliged to become spacefaring--not because of exploratory or romantic zeal, but for the most practical reason imaginable: staying alive... If our long-term survival is at stake, we have a basic responsibility to our species to venture to other worlds.
